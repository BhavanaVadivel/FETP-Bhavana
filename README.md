# FETP-Bhavana
## Description 
This repository contains my progress for the FETP task.

In Phase 1, I created a Flask application for local authentication with Gmail, displaying user information and the current Indian time.

## Progress Update
  **Phase 1: Implemented Flask application with Gmail authentication.**
  - Displayed user information.
  - Added a clickable "Sign Out" link.
  - Included the current Indian time in the display

   **Updated Authentication**
   - Corrected the initial misunderstanding of the authentication requirement and integrated the actual authentication mechanism into the Flask application.
  
  **Phase 2: Printing Design (Day 2)**
  - Added an input box for the "Number of Lines","Input text" and a "Display" button in the Flask UI.
  - Implemented logic to generate a pattern based on the number of lines input.
  - Treated Phase 2 as a separate task. In future updates will integrate this with successful authentication.
